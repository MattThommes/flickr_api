Flickr API scripts
==========

Working with the Flickr API.

## Installation

To get started, create a file called `auth_tokens.php` and put it in the same directory as the `fetch_photos.php` file (from this repository). The contents of `auth_tokens.php` should be:

	<?php

		$consumer_key = "";
		$consumer_secret = "";
		$token = "";
		$token_secret = "";

	?>
